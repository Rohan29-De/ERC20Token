# Minting Tokens

Only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
```
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```
To mint tokens, the owner should call the mint function with the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to mint.

# Burning Tokens

Any user can burn their own tokens.
```
function burn(uint256 amount) public {
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
To burn tokens, a user should call the burn function with the amount of tokens to burn.

# Transferring Tokens
